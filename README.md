# Medical-Diagnosis-Prediction-of-disease-from-symptoms.-
AIM:
The healthcare domain is one of the prominent research fields in the current scenario and the rapid improvement of technology and data.
It is quite difficult to handle the large amount of data of disease its symptoms, precautions and medication to be used.

DESCRIPTION:
This project depicts the prediction of disease based on symptoms using machine learning.
Its implementation is done through the python programming language.
The research demonstrates the best algorithm based on their accuracy.
The accuracy is determined by the performance on the given dataset.

MODEL:
We proposed general disease prediction based on symptoms of the patient.
For the disease prediction, we use Multinomial Bayes Classification for accurate prediction of disease.
For disease prediction require symptoms dataset.
The accuracy of general disease is 99%
After general disease prediction, this system able to gives the risk associated with general disease which is lower risk of general disease or higher.
